 Spectrum games are best known for great gameplay, high resolution graphics, great sound and.... er... colour clash! Some years back, a little known emulator known as Spec256 was released that allowed Specchums to play their favourite games in glorious 256 colours with no colour clash. While purists may argue that it takes away from the true feel of playing a game on the speccy, I believe what it also does is allow us to change the graphics without affecting the gameplay in anyway.

Have a look at some of the 256 colour games here and judge for yourself! You will need  Emuzwin to play these games.

The games listed on this page are the newer ones made using Emuzwin. The older Spec256 games meant for the Spec256 emulator can be found on the link the left. Note that Emuzwin can also play these games.

Please do read the notes at the bottom of this page. They contain important information that may save you hours of trouble later on.

Armando Quaranta has his own web-site for 256 colour games done by him where you can also find the games that he is currently working on.

Spec256 were the first ones to come up with a 256 colour format that could be overlaid over the graphics of normal spectrum games. Unfortunately, there was little or no documentation and tools to develop games in this format with the end result that Spec256 ended up doing all of the 256 colour games themselves. Eventually, they too stopped making 256 colour games and stopped development on the emulator. The baton has now been taken up by the excellent Emuzwin emulator and 256 colour games are back in business thanks to community participation.

On this page you will find the 256 colour games developed by the Spec256 team. You can play these games on both Spec256 as well as Emuzwin.

Notes:
1) Ultimate and Codemasters games are denied for distribution. The files for these games you download from here are only the graphics files required for 256 colour support. You'll have to look elsewhere for the actual snapshots of the files. Also, please note that 256 colour mode currently works ONLY with .SNA and .Z80 file formats.

2) If you can't get a 256 colour game to work despite having all the graphic and snapshot files, makes sure that the filename for the snapshot matches that of the .GFX file. Eg, ManicMiner.sna should correspond to the associated graphics file ManicMiner.GFX. Rename the snapshot if you have to.

Some files may be in the .EZX (Emuzwin) format), which encapsulates the entire game and the 256 colour graphics - in which case the the .Z80/.SNA snapshots are not required to play the game.
