Game: Cybernoid II
Publisher: Hewson
Author(s): Raffaele Cecco
Recolouring by: Armando Quaranta

The sequel to the highly acclaimed Cybernoid by Raffele Cecco features more of the same and then some more. Classic shoot-em up with some excellent graphics and fast action. Pixel perfect accuracy required to complete this one!



This is a 256 color version of Cybernoid II for the Zx Spectrum.
The game was already done, the graphics too, I merely " repainted " them using some of the tools 
that come with EmuZwin.
I borrowed a few sprites from the Spec256 version of Cybernoid and the Atari ST version of Cybernoid II,
 then reworked them myself.
To play this game with enhanched graphic you need an emulator capable of 256 color mode.
