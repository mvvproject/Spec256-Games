Bubbler 
256colour edition.
Initail release: 29th April 2004
Updated: 3rd May 2004

Original Game written by ACG/Ultimate

Coloured by MatGubbins.

Graphics have been coloured to my own personal 
preference. If you don`t like what I have done 
then get off your fat arse and create your own 
version.

The game play has not been altered in any way.


THIS GAME REQUIRES A .SNA FILE OF THE GAME TO WORK.
THIS FILE IS NOT INCLUDED WITH THIS DOWNLOAD.
DO NOT ASK ME FOR THE GAME.


Important bit: updated 3rd May 2004

There has been a bit of trouble with a few .sna files.
So, to get this game up and running properly you MUST 
do the following:

1: Load your original Bubbler tap/tzx file into the 
   emulator.

2: When the spinning BUBBLER logo appears, save a .sna
   file.

3: Reload the fresh .sna file.

4: Select GFX editor - if it is not highlighted then 
   EFFECTS - 256 Colors.
   Switch to 256 Colors and start GFXing now
   Make sure that the following are selected.
   Expand usual memory to GFX (0 to 00, 1 to FF)
   Skip all GFX bytes already having color info (not FF or 00)
   Allocated banks only
   Handle ROM also

   Press OK

5: Press the LOAD GFX Memory icon (top left corner)

6: Select the bubbler256.GFX file

7: Everthing should now be in 256 colours.
   The spinning Bubbler logo should now be coloured red.

8: Save a NEW .sna or .ezx file.

9: Play the game.

Please note:

Remember to save a new version of the game with all 
the 256 colour data.

Don`t save over your original .SNA file.
(If you do then don`t blame me!)
  
Reason:
Why have I got to do all this just to play the game?

The programmers of the game decided to invert all 
the program and graphic code. When the game loaded 
and ran, the game would inverse all the code so that
it would run properly.

Don`t try and use a .sna file that has the Bubbler 
loading screen on it. The game has to inverse all 
the bytes before use.

Also, don`t use a .sna file that has already had a 
game played on it - the bottle graphic may be reversed 
and the table data won`t be written over the spinning 
Bubbler logo - this will cause the graphics to appear 
corrupted in 256 mode.



==============================================

- Game POKES -

These pokes only work via the DEBUG WINDOW 
Press the 10 icon first to turn on DECIMAL mode!

Use as required. Original value in brackets.


POKE 38797,0 (202)
This will remove all nasty aliens, the lift and stop the 
bubble gun/tower from firing shots.
It does not stop the bonus bubbles from appearing.
Only poke the game WHEN IT HAS BEEN PAUSED!
If aliens are still on screen, then they will only dissapear 
when they have been killed.
You WILL need to poke the original value back in for some 
parts of each level to bring back the lift.


POKE 57515,0 (50)
POKE 57516,0 (222)
POKE 57517,0 (222)
These give infinate lives - required!
It also stops the clock for the FIRST LIFE ONLY!
(Your Sinclair made a complete hash of the description that 
I sent to them)




Known Problems
--------------

-Spinning Bubbler Logo-

The spinning logo appears only when the game has been loaded.
Once a key has been pressed, the logo is scrolled off screen.
The memory where the logo is stored is then overwritten with 
data.
SO... there will never be a spinning full colour 256 Bubbler 
logo as it is too much trouble trying to colour the bugger! 


-Menu Screen-

Scroller message prints a temporary graphic outside the box 
and then copies it inside the box.
POKEing the actual screen attriute with 0 does nothing.

-Game screen-

Scroller for the STAGE message prints a graphic next to the 
score and then copies it to the box.
As above.

Problem hopefully solved with various .sna files.
See above for the soloution.

- INITIAL RELEASE -

All main sprites are coloured and have been tested on all 
5 levels of the game.
Walkways remain as their original monotone colour so 
that it makes it easier to spot the nasties and the bullets.


- Info about some sprites - 

The graphics for the uncorked/corked bottles are only half drawn.
They are mirrored (in memory) during each frame update. 
Now you know why the game is so slow!

I`ve done everything that I wanted to change.
