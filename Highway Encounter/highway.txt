graphics to display properly. They are described in the fixes below.

The game play has not been altered in any way.

==============================================


Known Problems
--------------

-Zone 0-

To sort out the odd pixel here and there with the space ship. 
Due to the way that it is drawn in buffer memory it will be a hit and 
miss affair.

-Vortex logo on title screen-

Found m/c routine that colours the Vortex logo.
Changed the byte from 
48 (ink black, paper yellow) 
to 7 (ink white, paper black)
Poke 45333,7
Logo has also been coloured. 
There, that looks better!


---------------------
Fixed 15th April 2004
---------------------

SNA file is back to 128k version.

-Zone 0-

Ship now disolves when destroyed - yay!

-Display panel-

Active droid is now shown.

-Title Screen-

Although not 100% attribute accurate, the character set looks better. 


---------------------
Fixed 14th April 2004
---------------------

SNA file is now 48k in size.
This helps when graphics need to be edited with SGE.


-Zone 19,18,17,16-

Green attribute top left section.
Found character block that represented it.

-Zone 21-

Blue sea/river section top right of screen.
A bit more involved this... so sit tight.
Found the attributes (colour) that represented the 2 character blocks.
The attribute was 1 (decimal). 
Poked it to 15.
Inversed the graphics.
(Hard to explain, I know)
Poke 31073,15
Poke 31074,15

 
-Zone 17,16, 15-

Beach sea section bottom right of screen.
As described above, poked attrubute to 15, but did not require the graphics
to be inversed.
There is a very slight shade difference in the yellow.
Poke 31129,15
Poke 31130,15
Poke 31131,15

Zone 21,17,16 and 15 now look weird in normal mode.

-Messages-
 
LASERTRON ACTIVATED graphic found and coloured

-Odd pixels-

Here and there...

can be changed to say anything you want it to be (within reason).
